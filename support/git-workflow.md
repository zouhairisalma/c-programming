# A quick start for git workflow
After forking the repository from the github website, you will have your own copy of the original repository `c-programming`, user `git clone` with the link from your forked repository to bring it in your local machine. e.g (`git clone https://github.com/MostafaMamouni/c-programming`).

Now, you can edit your files inside the repository. And then you can follow their changes by `git status` and commit the changes by `git commit -m "your commit message"`, and then `git push` (if it's the fist push you can user `git push --set-upstream origin branch_name`) to submit your work to your github repository.

To get the latest changes fromt the forked repository, you need to open a `pull request`.
go to pull requests page at github

after setting up your pull request, you can go to your repository directory and use `git pull` to get the changes from the forked repository. more about this topic in [here](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/git-github/github-collaboration/update-github-repositories-with-changes-by-others/)
